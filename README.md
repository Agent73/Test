The process by which the universe could be destroyed is by using a megalarge Hadron collider which if it could
create enough energy by colliding Higgs Bosons and proton masses could offset the Higgs quantum field
thereby creating a quantum vaccuum that would travel at the speed of light changing all known laws of physics as long as the higgs field is unstable enough

**Reasons why?**

*Why not
## it could be fun

1. reason

2. cool science stuff

3. yes...

We should destroy the universe to save the universe #metoo
